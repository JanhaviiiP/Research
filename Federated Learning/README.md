## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Privacy Protection**: Federated Learning enables data privacy by ensuring that data remains on local devices.
- **Reduced Risk of Data Breaches**: Since data isn’t transmitted to a central server, the risk of centralized data breaches is minimized.
- **Improved Personalization**: Localized training allows models to be more tailored to individual user behaviors.

### Disadvantages
- **Communication Overhead**: Transmitting model updates between devices and servers can be resource-intensive.
- **Limited Data Access**: Since the raw data is never centralized, it may limit certain types of analyses and model improvements.
- **Security Concerns**: Although data is not shared, model updates themselves can potentially leak information without additional privacy measures.
